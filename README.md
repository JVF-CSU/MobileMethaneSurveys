This GitHub repository is for sharing the implemented version of the algorithm represented in the paper (which will be published very soon) to the public.

## Abstract
- The data collected by mobile methane (CH4) sensors can be used to find natural gas (NG) leaks in urban distribution systems. Extracting actionable insights from the large volumes of data collected by these sensors requires several data processing steps. While these survey platforms are commercially available, the associated data processing software largely constitute a black box due to their proprietary nature. This repository holds the code (also referred to as 'algorithm') that we use to process data from mobile methane surveys in order to develop maps of leak indications and locations that have been surveyed two or more times with the mobile surveyor. Mobile surveys are already an effective and necessary tool for managing NG distribution systems, but improvements in the technology and software will continue to increase its value.
